# email

The code needs access to your gmail account to be able to send the password.
To benefit from this code you need to; from your gmail account generate an App Password.
Below will be instructions on how to do this (you can also watch tutorials or search on google).

In your Google Account settings, under "Security," find the "App passwords" section.
Choose "Select app" and select "Mail" from the dropdown.
Choose your device (you can select "Other (Custom name)" if you want).
Click "Generate."
A generated app password will be displayed. This is the password your Python bot will use to authenticate.
